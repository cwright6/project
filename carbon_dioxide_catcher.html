		<h2>Carbon Dioxide Capture</h2>
		
		<p>Imagine a scenario where an evil super-genius finds a way to suck all the oxygen out of the air, then buries it in the 
		ground. Sound like the stuff of comic books? Well, yes, if we're talking about oxygen. But scientists are working on a way
		to do just that with carbon dioxide. Why capture carbon dioxide from the air? To combat global warming.</p>
		
		<p>Human inventions like power plants and transportation vehicles, which burn fossil fuels, release extra CO2 into the air. 
		Because we've added (and continue to add) this carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, more heat is stored on Earth, which causes 
		the temperature of the planet to slowly rise, a phenomenon called global warming.</p>
		
		<p>Carbon dioxide isn't the only greenhouse gas (GHG). Others include water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, 
		perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. Scientists estimate that global GHG emissions due to human activities increased 70 percent
		between 1970 and 2004. Carbon dioxide emissions alone grew 80 percent in the same period [source: IPCC]. Many researchers believe 
		that the process of carbon capture and storage can help us to get this number down to a healthy level.</p>
		
		<p>Carbon capture involves trapping the carbon dioxide at its emission source, transporting it to a storage location 
		(usually deep underground) and isolating it. This means we could potentially grab excess CO2 right from the power plant, 
		creating greener energy.</p>
		
		<h3>Carbon Capture Technology</h3>
		
		<p>Carbon capture has actually been in use for years. The oil and gas industries have used carbon capture for decades as a way to 
		enhance oil and gas recovery [source: CSS]. Only recently have we started thinking about capturing carbon for environmental reasons.</p>

		<p>Currently, most research focuses on carbon capture at fossil fuel-powered energy plants, the source of the majority of man-made CO2 
		emissions. Many of these power plants rely on coal to create energy, and the burning of coal emits CO2 into the atmosphere. Some researchers
		envision a future where all new power plants employ carbon capture.</p>

		<p>There are three main steps to carbon capture and storage (CCS) -- trapping and separating the CO2 from other gases, transporting this 
		captured CO2 to a storage location, and storing that CO2 far away from the atmosphere (underground or deep in the ocean). Let's take a 
		more detailed look at the trapping and separation process­:</p>

		<p>Carbon is taken from a power plant source in three basic ways -- post-combustion, precombustion and oxy-fuel combustion. A fossil 
		fuel power plant generates power by burning fossil fuel (coal, oil or natural gas), which generates heat that turns into steam. That 
		steam turns a turbine connected to an electricity generator. We call the process that turns the turbine combustion.</p>

		<p>With post-combustion ­carbon capture, the CO2 is grabbed after the fossil fuel is burned. The burning of fossil fuels­ produces something 
		called flue gase­s, which include CO2, water vapor, sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides. In a post-combustion process, CO2 is separated and 
		captured from the flue gases that result from the combustion of fossil fuel. This process is currently in use to remove CO2 from natural gas. 
		The biggest benefit to using this process is that it allows us to retrofit older power plants, by adding a "filter" that helps trap the CO2 as
		it travels up a chimney or smokestack. This filter is actually a solvent that absorbs carbon dioxide. The solvent can later be heated, which will
		release water vapor and leave behind a concentrated stream of CO2.­ Post-combustion carbon capture can prevent 80 to 90 percent of a power plant's
		carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. But the post-combustion process requires a lot of energy to compress the gas
		enough for transport.</p>

		<p>With precombustion carbon capture,­ CO2 is trapped before the fossil fuel is burned. That means the CO2 is trapped before it's diluted by other
		flue gases. Coal, oil or natural gas is heated in pure oxygen, resulting in a mix of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This mix is then treated in a 
		catalytic converter with steam, which then produces more hyd­rogen, along with carbon dioxide. These gases are fed into the bottom of a flask. 
		The gases in the flask will naturally begin to rise, so a chemical called amine is poured into the top. The amine binds with the CO2, falling to 
		the bottom of the flask. The hydrogen continues rising, up and out of the flask. Next, the amine/CO2 mixt­ure is heated. The CO2 rises to the top 
		for collection, and the amine drops to the bottom for reuse [source:­ Allen]. The excess hydrogen also can be used for other energy production
		processes.</p>

		<p>Precombustion carbon capture is already in use for natural gas, and provides a much higher concentration of CO2 than post-combustion. The 
		precombustion process is lower in cost, but it's not a retrofit for older power plant generators. As with post-combustion, precombustion carbon
		capture can prevent 80 to 90 percent of a power plant's emissions from entering the atmosphere.</p>

		<p>With oxy-fuel combustion carbon capture, the power plant burns fossil fuel in oxygen. This results in a gas mixture comprising mostly steam
		and CO2. The steam and carbon dioxide are separated by cooling and compressing the gas stream. The oxygen required for this technique increases 
		costs, but researchers are developing new techniques in hopes of bringing this cost down. Oxy-fuel combustion can prevent 90 percent of a power
		plant's emissions from entering the atmosphere.</p>
